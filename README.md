## Version Control Guidelines

This project follows structured GitHub-based version control practices to ensure clean, collaborative, and efficient development.
Below are the guidelines for working within this repository.

### Branching Strategy

- **Main branch**: The `main` branch contains the official version of the project that is intended for TA review abd submissions (e.g., proto, midterm, final).
  - This branch is only merged to when a milestone has been reached.
  - Each submission is marked with a name corresponding its version (e.g., proto, midterm, final).
- **Development branch**: The `dev` branch serves as the active development branch. It integrates completed feature branches and acts as the staging area before merging into `main`.
- **Feature branches**: Each new feature, bug fix, or update should be developed in its own descriptive branch:
  - feat/your-feature-name: for new features
